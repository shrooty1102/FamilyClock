Remember the wall clock that told *Molly Weasly* about the whereabouts of her children?

Imagine your daughter travelling from one city to another. Can you track her position continuously and be assured she is on track?
Remember when your kids went away to summer camp and you were always worried if they had their food and slept on time.

**Introducing Family Clock** - so that you can keep track of your loved ones, family and friends.

In a very simple way, your phone can be registered to the service and begin sending the updates. You can then add the friends you want to track, invite them if they already haven't joined the service, and start tracking their position.

Planning a large get together and worried if your friends will reach the right place? Create a group of the guests and keep tracking their positions so that you known when someone goes out of the way.  

**Features** -

1. Quick registration very similar to whatsapp
2. Update *what are you doing*
3. Update your location manually or via GPS
4. Create groups to track different circles of family and friends

**Futures** -

1. Add a map to show locations of all members of a group
2. Use reverse geocoding to get exact position from GPS
3. Intelligently identify location periodically based on frequent locations of Work and Home

[Reference][1] -
The Weasley Clock was a clock owned by the Weasley family which individually monitored each of their whereabouts. Located in the living room at The Burrow, the clock had nine golden hands, one for every member of the household.

Notes -

1. This is based on the idea from Harry Potter books from J. K. Rowling.
2. This is just a prototype.
3. You need to add the group member using phone number - ideally it will be added by just choosing a contact.
4. Not much security and error handling in place yet - so please do not hack the hack.
5. There are known legal issues when using Harry Potter items and hence this hack bears resemblance to it only for the duration of the hackathon and its evaluation.
